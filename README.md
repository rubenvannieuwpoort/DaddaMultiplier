# Dadda tree multiplier

This repository contains a Xilinx ISE project with a VHDL implementation of a [Dadda tree multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadda_multiplier).

Multipliers are the hardware that implement the multiplication operation. A multiplication of two n-bit numbers generates a number of at most 2n bits. This implementation is a type of an array multiplier, which means that all the partial products are generated by placing the bits of the operands in an n-by-n array. All the partial products are then efficiently accumulated in a [carry save adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-save_adder) tree. The last addition can be done by a fast adder (such as a Brent-Kung adder). This is (probably) not necessary for an FPGA implementation, because most modern FPGA's have a fast-carry chain, which allows for fast multiplication.
